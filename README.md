apprently incorrectly submitted the wrong classes project last week and have no reference of the actual project that was requested. so i uploaded the file i wrongly submitted last week just to demonstrate i can upload to github.


    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

        i guess interpreting user needs really falls down to the product owner / my experience as user needs can vary greatly between users, thats why user stories are so helpful, because it gives a clear outline of what is needed to be done and the direction we are heading. or what has already been done.

        
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
        i approach development in a professional environment to scalability, chances are high the user base will grow and we need to think about the future programmers that need to work on our product or just the product in general. Really i am just looking forward to actually working with a team and using cooperation in a scrum environment to build things, it will be a nice change from sitting alone in my home doing things that dont pay anything or serve any purpose other than learning.


    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
      A good team member has clear communication, is open to new ideas and helps people with lesser experience willingly without hesitation or personal gain who they see may be struggling on something that may not be so complicated. i think a good team member figures out what needs to be done *clear guidelines* and follows them to a *T* and then does slightly extra in quality standards. only slightly as mostly extra is seen to be a waste of time in a lot of situations. I want to trust this person and i want to help this person.
